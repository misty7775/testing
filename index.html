<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<p>hey it's gimmy mc willy here!</p>

<p>I am the cousin of odin de ligma.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:rgb(1, 255, 22);">who is cousin twice removed and one blood line across from quandale dingle.</h2>

<p>I am here to understand the quantum mechanics of a neuclear fusion reactor os i can power my new gaming pc with a <b>gtx1060ti</b> and <i>intel I3 6100</i>.</p>

<p>to understand how im to power this beast of a rig i must understand basic quantum phisics.</p>
<a href="https://www.instructables.com/Build-A-Fusion-Reactor/">https://www.instructables.com/Build-A-Fusion-Reactor/</a>
<p>as this article states (https://www.britannica.com/technology/fusion-reactor)The energy-producing mechanism in a fusion reactor is the joining together of two light atomic nuclei. When two nuclei fuse, a small amount of mass is converted into a large amount of energy. </p>

<p>utilising  this we can power my pc :).</p>

<p>but. how do we make a fusion reactor? we know how it works, but not how to build one.</p>

<p>the basic components of a fusion reactor would be by this website <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Build-A-Fusion-Reactor/">https://www.instructables.com/Build-A-Fusion-Reactor/</a> </p>


<li>-A vacuum chamber, preferably in a spherical shape</li>
<li>-A roughing vacuum pump capable of reaching at least 75 microns vacuum</li>
<li>-A secondary high vacuum pump, either a turbo pump or oil diffusion pump</li>
<li>-A high voltage supply, preferably capable of at least 40kv 10ma - Must be negative polarity</li>
<li>-A high voltage divider probe for use with a digital multimeter</li>
<li>-A thermocouple or baratron (of appropriate scale) vacuum gauge</li>
<li>-A neutron radiation detector, either a proportional He-3 or BF3 tube with counting instrumentation, or a bubble dosimeter</li>
<li>-A Geiger counter, preferably a scintillator type, for x-ray detection and safety</li>
<li>-Deuterium gas (can be purchased as a gas or extracted from D2O through electrolysis - it is much easier and more effective to use compressed gas)</li>
<li>-A large ballast resistor in the range of 50-100k and at least a foot long</li>
<li>-A camera and TV display for viewing the inside of the reactor</li>
<li>-Lead to shield the camera viewport</li>
<li>-General engineering tools, a machine shop if at all possible (although 90% of mine was built with nothing but a dremel and cordless drill, the only thing you really can't build without a shop is scratch building the vacuum chamber)</li>

<p>ok now for the time lapse.</p>

<p>now that we have a fusion reactor we neet to tun it on. but gimmie mc willie, how?</p>

<p>well what we do is flip the switch and now we have power.</p>

<h3>wait whats happening...NOOOOOOOO!</h3>

<p>ok so the gpu was a lie, turns out it was cardboard. now we must go to Amazon and purchace the gpu.</p>

<p>ut oh looks like we hap poarch pirates and the are running away. good thing we are in america lol.</p>

<p>ok now they are gone never to pirate again. speaking of pirates, we must go to pirates bay and down load windows xp. the newest version of windows.</p>

<p>if it runs a bit slow the its working. now we must download steam and get the new game that came out. whats the game called, we will save that for the next episode of dragon ball z. but for now we must download steam, go to google and hit download, bam now you got it. now you must got to get minecraft.free.com and get minecraft.</p>

<p>now its time to play. have funn and i will see you in my next blog. good bie.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>do you want ot hear a story?</p>

<p>hello My name is Aidan Reschke. I brows the internet constantly, wethere thats on youtube or discord im always connected, always.</p>

<P>One day I was browsing youtube and i saw a peculiar thumbnail. It was realy odd, it contained a blue background and a newspaper or magasine or something.
  And this absolutly caught my eye, so i looked at the time stamp and saw the 6 and a half hour runtime and was shocked 
  nothing ive ever watched was that long. I looked at the title of the video and it stated "Everywhere at the End of Time stages 1-6".
  I was baffled that some one could make a video this long. so I saved it and moved on.
</P>
